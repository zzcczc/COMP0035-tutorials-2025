# COMP0035 Activities 6: Requirements and wireframes

Theme: **Designing applications**

The next two sets of activities do not involve coding.

This week's activities introduce you to:

- techniques for documenting requirements
- wireframes

The activities are **not** exemplars for the coursework; since many of the examples are partial solutions only.

There are other techniques that can be used for this stage beyond the few covered here; students aiming for higher marks
are encouraged to read more widely for this topic and to choose an appropriate blend of methods to use. There are some
activities on Moodle that introduce other techniques.
