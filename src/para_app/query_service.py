""" Example queries

Python classes are typically used when you need to encapsulate data and related functions.

So why not add the CRUD methods to the model classes?

You can do that. One reason you might not is the design principle, separation of concerns. Separation of concerns
helps to avoid large, bloated classes that can be harder to maintain, harder to re-use and harder to test.

You might decide to keep the models representing the data structure separate from the business logic handling services
such as validation and queries.

Developers using frameworks such as FastAPI often use an architecture that separates the app into layers:

- Models: to represent the data
- Schemas: using Pydantic for validation
- Services: for the business logic
- Routers (controllers): API end-points

This activity is only using SQLModel, though you can use Pydantic schemas in coursework 2 if you wish.
Do not use FastAPI for this coursework please, that is in COMP0034.

class QueryService:
    """ Class with database queries

        Use to demonstrate example queries in the tutorial.

        DEMO of all basic CRUD:
            Read all hosts
            Create a new host city
            Read the new host
            Update the host city name
            Delete the new host city

        Write queries for:
            DEMO: 1. List all Paralympics (games) with their year and type. Order by year.
            DEMO: 2. List all winter Paralympics (games) with host name(s) and year.
            3. Find all disabilities recorded in the database.
            4. Get all Paralympics (Games) that took place after the year 2000. Order by year.
            5. Find all teams from a specific region (e.g. Oceania). Order by team name.
            6. List all hosts located in a specific country (e.g., 'Italy') and the year they held the Paralympics.
            7. Show all Paralympics (games) along with their host city and host country.
