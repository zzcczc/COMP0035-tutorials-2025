# Introduction

_*Theme: Using Python to work with data*_

This topic relates to coursework 2. It is not needed for coursework 1.

This week introduces concepts related to classes and how these may be used when working with data from databases. You
should work through all the activities as the concepts are related and knowledge should be progressively built through
the activities.

Each type of class discussed in activities 1, 2, and 4 varies in syntax which can seem confusing. You will
mostly use SQLModel with an SQLite database in COMP0034 and COMP0035, so focus on that syntax.

The main aims this week are that you understand:

- what is a class, its attributes and methods
- what does it mean when one class "inherits" from another
- that ORM is a pattern for mapping from a Python class to a database table

... and that you are able to:

- Define a class using SQLModel that maps to a database table
- Create an SQLite database from classes defined using SQLModel
