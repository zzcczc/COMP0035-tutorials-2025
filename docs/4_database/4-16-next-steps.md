# 16. Further practice

1. Create an ERD for a data set with more entities and attributes

   These activities used a the 'paralympic games' and 'team codes' data in
   the [paralympics_all_raw.xlsx](../../src/activities/data/paralympics_all_raw.xlsx) file.

   There is a further worksheet with the medal tables. Design additional tables to store this data, then update the
   schema and add the tables to the database file.

2. Find online tutorials such as:
    - [Visual Paradigm: explains the concepts and provides an example](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/data-modeling/what-is-entity-relationship-diagram/;WWWSESSIONID=1EAF6AF9532B727E5D05D2601FFF1B66.www1)
    - [Freecodecamp video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc) on database design
    - [GURU99 Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram Model with DBMS Example](https://www.guru99.com/er-diagram-tutorial-dbms.html)

3. See database links in the Reading List for COMP0035.

## Apply the knowledge to the coursework

- Read the coursework 1 specification so you know what it asks you to produce. It does not ask for every step that has
