# 6. Using SQLModel to add data to an SQLite database

To add a single record to a database table is conceptually similar to the code used with sqlite: create the instance,
add it, commit it.

```python
hero_1 = Hero(name="Deadpond", secret_name="Dive Wilson")
hero_2 = Hero(name="Spider-Boy", secret_name="Pedro Parqueador")

engine = create_engine("sqlite:///database.db")

with Session(engine) as session:
    session.add(hero_1)
    session.add(hero_2)
    session.commit()
```

To add data to the database, you can read the values into classes and create object instances. There are many ways you
could do this. Since you already have code to read from .xslx into a pandas DataFrame, use that. The code would be
structured something like this:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sqlmodel import Session, SQLModel, create_engine
from mymodels import MyData  # Replace with your actual model

# 1. Read Excel file
df = pd.read_excel("your_data.xlsx")

# 2. Convert DataFrame rows to SQLModel instances
records = []
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    record = MyData(**row.to_dict())
    records.append(record)

# 3. Insert into database
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///mydatabase.db")
with Session(engine) as session:
    session.add_all(records)
    session.commit()
```

Adding data to the paralympics database is more complex than the example above due to the number of tables and the
relationships. This is skipped for now and covered in week 8.
